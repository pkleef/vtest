# Reporting a Vulnerability
In the first instance, send a detailed email to
me
to report a possible vulnerability in Virtuoso, even if you are
uncertain whether the issue in question is an exploitable vulnerability.

Please add as much detail as possible in your report, including:

 * version information from the binary
 * where you compiled/downloaded this binary from
 * short description (or script) to demonstrate the issue

You should receive an acknowledgement within a few business days,
which may include requests for additional details.

Followups, including notification of a relevant patch, will be sent
as appropriate.


## Supported Versions
Currently there is no official "Long-Term Support" version.
